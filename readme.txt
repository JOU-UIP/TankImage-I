---------------THE COLLECTION OF TANK IMAGE SEQUENCES---------------------
The underwater image sequence database is collected in a tank.
The tank is 2.53m long, 1.02m width and 1.03m high, with observation 
windows at both sides. The targets are the SFR board and the ColorChecker 
24X-Rite Chart (21.59×27.94cm). The transparency is measured by the blackboard 
method .[R. J. Davies-Colley, ”Measuring water clarity with a black disk,” Limnol.
Oceanogr., vol. 33, no. 4, pp. 616-623, 1988.] The sequences images were taken with 
OTI-UWC-325/P/E color camera. We used a special lighting system with LED (Light 
Emitting Diode) lights of high power to simulate the underwater illumination. 
The objects were put 45cm under the surface and the depth of water is 90cm. 
The lighting source is put aside of the camera with 50cm. We keep the camera and 
the light stationary and move the target by distance.

######The three folders named  Clear, Mid ,Turbid totally contain 78 images.All images have 960*576 pixels.
The format of the image is BMP.



-------------------------DETAILS OF FILES PROVIDED IN THIS RELEASE--------------------------------

######This dataset, which is named as TankImage-I, is constituted of six image sequences of SFR board and 
ColorChecker taken in three levels of turbidity of water. These images are of Imatest SFR board and the ColorChecker
chart  to represent the distortion on clarityand color aspects individuallyThe images are captured with increasing imaging
distance range from 50cm to 120cm with or without extra illumination. 

######This dataset we released contains 78 underwater images of two targets along with part irradiance measurement.
The file contains three folders named Clear，Mid ，Turbid，each containing four folders.
These four folders are SFR_led,SFR_natural，ColorChart_led and ColorChart_natural. SFR and ColorChart are the targets of the
shoot. Led and Natural are whether there is led light in the shooting target.

######The first folder is called clear and contains 31 pictures. The first name of each image is the shooting target, the second 
is the turbidity, the third is the distance to camera, and the fourth is whether there is an LED light.The turbidty in water is 325cm.

######The second folder is called Mid and contains 30 pictures.The first name of each image is the shooting target, the 
second is the turbidity, the third is the distance to the camera, and the fourth is whether there is an LED light.The turbidty 
in water is 182cm.

######The third folder, called Turbid, contains 17 images. The first name of each image is the shooting target, the second is 
the turbidity, thethird is the distance to camera, and the fourth is whether there is an LED light.The turbidty in water is 85cm.
